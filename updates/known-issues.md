## Current Known Issues

- **DOCUMENTATION** Incomplete, especially for getting started, features and nodes.
- **UI/UX** The undo/redo functionality is unreliable in some scenarios.
- **UI/UX** If you close a panel, you cannot reopen it, when there is no flow active because the buttons are in the editor.
- **UI/UX** The connections can be created on the same input many times. In some cases this is correct, but in most it's not. This needs an update.
- **UI/UX** If you go to a sub-form, and then close it, you won't go back to the original form. (for example: go to secrets, and through secrets to manage stages)
- **UI/UX** The error log node, does not accept a dict on the message input, which sucks.
- **UI/UX** Check the log panel, it sometimes does not show the logs from the log node (possibly local issue).
- **UI/UX** The documentation is in the ui, but it needs to be added to the bottom bar, and then link to the internal documentation.
- **NODES** Not all nodes have been tested extensively, so there may be bugs in nodes.
- **NODES AGNO** Still in development, not all features are implemented.
