# PolySynergy Orchestrator

---

## üöß Work in Progress

**This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for local installation and setup.** Work is in progress to make AWS cloud dependencies optional to enable easier local development and testing. Please check back soon for updates.

### üîó Submodule Repositories

The following components are maintained as separate repositories and included as git submodules:

- **[Portal](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-portal)** - Next.js visual workflow editor
- **[API Local](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-api-local)** - FastAPI orchestration backend
- **[Router](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-router)** - Dynamic request routing service
- **[Node Runner](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-node-runner)** - Python workflow execution framework
- **[Nodes](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-nodes)** - Core node library with AI agents and integrations
- **[Nodes Agno](https://github.com/dionsnoeijen/polysynergy-nodes-agno)** - Additional specialized nodes

## Overview

PolySynergy Orchestrator is a **microservices-based visual automation platform** that enables users to create, manage, and execute node-based workflows through an intuitive drag-and-drop interface. Build complex automation pipelines with AI agents, integrations, and custom logic - all through a visual canvas.

- **Memory Management**: Persistent chat memory with DynamoDB backend
- **Dynamic Tool Integration**: Automatic tool discovery and execution

### Enterprise-Grade Infrastructure
- **Scalable Architecture**: Microservices design with Docker containerization
- **Cloud Agnostic**: Flexible deployment options across different providers
- **Security First**: OIDC authentication, role-based access, encrypted secrets
- **Cost Effective**: Optimized for performance without excessive cloud costs

### Extensive Node Library
- **Utility Nodes**: Math operations, data transformation, file handling
- **Integration Nodes**: HTTP requests, database operations, email services
- **Control Flow**: Conditional logic, loops, scheduling, and branching
- **Custom Nodes**: Extensible framework for building your own nodes

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

PolySynergy follows a modern microservices architecture designed for scalability and maintainability:

### Core Services

- **Portal** (Next.js): Visual workflow editor with real-time collaboration
- **API Local** (FastAPI): Main orchestration engine and workflow management
- **Router** (FastAPI): Dynamic request routing to Lambda functions
- **Node Runner**: Python framework for workflow execution
- **Database Layer**: PostgreSQL for persistence, Redis for caching

### Infrastructure

- **Container Orchestration**: Docker Compose for local development
- **Example Cloud Architecture**: Terraform configurations for AWS deployment (reference implementation)
- **Cost Optimization**: Moved away from expensive AWS services to more economical solutions
- **Flexible Deployment**: Designed to work with various hosting providers and configurations
