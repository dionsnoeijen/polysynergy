# Creating a Schedule in PolySynergy Studio

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a secret in PolySynergy Studio. A secret is used to store sensitive information, such as API keys, passwords, or tokens, securely within your workflows.

You can add a secret to the flow, by pressing the + button, or by using it in an input field like this: `<secret:the_secret_key>`.

## Open PolySynergy Studio Editor
On the left, you see a plus button with "Secrets". Click that button.
![Add Route](http://localhost:8090/api/v1/documentation/assets/images/tutorial-create-secret.png)

Then a form will appear, where you can configure the secret.
