# Creating a Schedule in PolySynergy Studio

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create a schedule in PolySynergy Studio. A schedule allows you to run your workflows at specified intervals or times, enabling automated processes without manual intervention.

## Open PolySynergy Studio Editor
On the left, you see a plus button with "Schedules". Click that button.

Then a form will appear, where you can configure the schedule.

The orange node is the Mock node. You can configure data, to mimick a real call.

The blue node is the one you can use to start the actual flow. In a production situation, this will be the starting point. (As opposed to a mock situation where the orange mock node is the starting point).
