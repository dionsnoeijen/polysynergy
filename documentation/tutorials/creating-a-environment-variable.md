# Creating a Schedule in PolySynergy Studio

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to create an environment variable in PolySynergy Studio. An environment variable is used to store variables that should have a different value per stage (environment).

You can add a secret to the flow, by pressing the + button, or by using it in an input field like this: `<environment:the_env_var_key>`.

## Open PolySynergy Studio Editor
On the left, you see a plus button with "Environment Variables". Click that button.

Then a form will appear, where you can configure the secret.
